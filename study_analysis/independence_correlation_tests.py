####### Example of the Pearson's Correlation test
#Tests whether two samples have a linear relationship.

#Assumptions

#Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
#Observations in each sample are normally distributed.
#Observations in each sample have the same variance.
#Interpretation

#H0: the two samples are independent.
#H1: there is a dependency between the samples.

data2 = [0.353, 3.517, 0.125, -7.545, -0.555, -1.536, 3.350, -1.578, -3.537, -1.579]

##### Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation
#Tests whether two samples have a monotonic relationship.
# They do NOT need to be normally distributed

#Assumptions
#Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
#Observations in each sample can be ranked.

#Interpretation
#H0: the two samples are independent.
#H1: there is a dependency between the samples.

######## Chi-Squared Test
# Tests whether two categorical variables are related or independent.

# Assumptions

# Observations used in the calculation of the contingency table are independent.
# 25 or more examples in each cell of the contingency table.

#Interpretation
#H0: the two samples are independent.
#H1: there is a dependency between the samples.

## Another more uncommon way, that leads to the same result:
prob = 0.95
critical = chi2.ppf(prob, dof)
print('probability=%.3f, critical=%.3f, stat=%.3f' % (prob, critical, stat))
if abs(stat) >= critical:
